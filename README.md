GPS –Robotic Process Automation Using UiPath
Automated CR Web / RCP screen modules using UI Path tool that uses Robotic  process automation to automate Sanity test cases of GPS Application which involves 40+ complex manual steps that was performed manually on daily basis by test team earlier.  
UiPath automatically runs these test suite and sends out a detailed report along with snapshot so team can review and identify the failure point. for further investigation.              
This tool can be used to automate the regression / progression test cases which significantly reduces the manual effort.  
One more benefit of this tool is it can automate a desktop based application which cant be achieved using Selenium
